# SELLERY CODE LOGS OCT. 24
### Here is the start of the IMDb copycat. The idea is to get all of the people that are a part of sellery cinema to rank and view the movies that we watch as a group and create a schedule of upcoming movies.

### Progress: 
### Today I built the foundation and created an api pull from TMBD that pulls the movie name and the overview and gives that data to the fastHTML frontend. The fastHTML allows the user to pick any movie and outputs the overview and the image of the movie. I used the hx_swap_oob to replace the movie name and regenerate the image so the page can update dynamically

### Required packages: 
1. pip install python-fasthtml

# EXTRA INFO
### There are 3 packages to this Repo, the fightClub.py is the main script that should be run. movieDB.py and getText.py are extra files I created to get the indivual pieces of the main script. They have no function, but provide some use if you wish to understand the process.
